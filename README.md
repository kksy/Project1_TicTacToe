# Project1-TicTacToe

## Overview
A Tic Tac Toe game, which is my first project as a Web Development Immersive student at General Assembly

<b>Live Demo</b>: http://kksy.github.io/Project1_TicTacToe/

## Features
+ Tic Tac Toe game using images as markers
+ Scoreboard and round number tracking
+ Reset game and continue game functions
+ Changing square colour on hover for highlighting
+ Changing markers
+ Alert using manually made modal window

## Technologies
+ HTML5
+ CSS3
+ Javascript, including
  - jQuery

## Known Issues
+ On mobile, the modals sit too low on the screen when zoomed in portrait view
+ Clicking the last row of squares expands the container for the board on Firefox

## Suggestions
+ Instead of using buttons as container for the markers, use div
+ Instead of making new image elements for the markers, try changing the div background property
