### Known Bugs
+ On mobile, the modals sit too low on the screen when zoomed in portrait view
+ Clicking the last row of squares expands the container for the board on Firefox

### Suggestions
+ Instead of using buttons as container for the markers, use div
+ Instead of making new image elements for the markers, try changing the div background property

## Past Commit

+ Overwriting of other player's marker
